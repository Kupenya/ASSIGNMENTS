            <p class="story"><br>My name is Alphonsus Glory, I am most times introverted and other times extroverted, i guess that's why the word ambivert exist.<br><br>So since this is where i promise to be me,
               let me begin by taking you through my tech not so tech journey.
               I picked interest in graphics design at first because I wanted to help my business HAIRPESTLE, along the line, a number of people wanted me to replicate designs for their own brand,
               then I thought to myself, why not expand your knowledge in this?<br><br> 
               So it started! I started of by learning graphics designing, then I diversified into product design in 2021, thanks to Ingressive4good x ZuriInternship my journey into the UI/UX world started off,
               I have replicated a number of designs and have worked as a freelancer for a number of project.
               I decided to improve my human capital so I learnt branding;Geneza, I also learnt Digital marketing & content creation; Sidehustleinternship.
               I am drawn towards learning and implementing. I love solving problems.<br><br> My UI designs are responsive, my UX skills are unmatched. Whatever I touch, I bring more life, so I decided to give back to the community 
               so I started Gadzira Designs a start-up that tutors online businesses on how to position brands, create designs & videos, how to target audience, basically everything needed to have a successful online business.</p>
